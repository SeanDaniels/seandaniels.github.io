<p>I am using this space as an environment to learn and practice a few things. In no particular order, my goals are to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Practice documenting code</li>
  <li>Practice explaining code</li>
  <li>Practice version controlling code</li>
  <li>Practice sharing executable code</li>
  <li>Learn a greater range of front end skills</li>
</ul>

<p>This will probably be messy and frequently broken. Thank you for understanding.</p>
