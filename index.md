## Hello, Sean here

I am using this space as an environment to learn and practice a few things. In no particular order, my goals are to:

- Practice documenting code
- Practice explaining code
- Practice version controlling code
- Practice sharing executable code
- Learn a greater range of front end skills

This will probably be messy and frequently broken. Thank you for understanding.

As you can see by the (current) footer of this page, I am using Jekyll to attempt to accomplish the front end goals. Thetheme I am using is Minimal Mistakes. I chose this theme because the theme's creator provided excellent documentation, and I plan to implement some of theme's features on my own, using the theme's files as a template.
