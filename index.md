# Hello, Sean here

I am using this space as an environment to learn and practice a few things. In no particular order, my goals are to:

- Practice documenting code
- Practice explaining code
- Practice version controlling code
- Practice sharing executable code
- Learn a greater range of front end skills

This will probably be messy and frequently broken. Thank you for understanding.
